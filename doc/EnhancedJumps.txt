DESCRIPTION					   *EnhancedJumps-description*

This plugin enhances the built-in |CTRL-I|/|CTRL-O| jump commands: 
- After a jump, the line, column and text of the next jump target are printed: 
    next: 3,9 ENHANCED JUMPS    by Ingo Karkat ~
- An error message and the valid range for jumps in that direction is printed
  if a jump outside the jump list is attempted: 
    Only 8 older jump positions. ~
- In case the next jump would move to another buffer, only a warning is
  printed at the first attempt:
    next: EnhancedJumps.vim ~
  The jump to another buffer is only done if the same jump command is repeated
  once more immediately afterwards; like this: Pressing CTRL-O, noticing the
  warning, then quickly pressing CTRL-O again to overcome the warning. 
  With this, you can eagerly jump around the current buffer. Because you will
  be warned when a jump would move to another buffer, you're much less likely
  to get lost. 

==============================================================================
USAGE							 *EnhancedJumps-usage*

Simply use the |CTRL-O| and |CTRL-I| commands to go to an older / newer cursor
position in the jump list. When a warning "next: {file}" is echoed, quickly
repeat the jump command to move to that buffer (a [count] need to not be
typed again; if you do include the [count], it must be the same as before). 
If you do not want to move to that buffer, just ignore the warning, and
continue browsing the current buffer. On the next jump attempt, the warning
will be repeated. 

==============================================================================
INSTALLATION					  *EnhancedJumps-installation*

This script is packaged as a|vimball|. If you have the "gunzip" decompressor
in your PATH, simply edit the *.vba.gz package in Vim; otherwise, decompress
the archive first, e.g. using WinZip. Inside Vim, install by sourcing the
vimball or via the|:UseVimball|command. >
    vim EnhancedJumps.vba.gz
    :so %
To uninstall, use the|:RmVimball|command. 

DEPENDENCIES					  *EnhancedJumps-dependencies*

- Requires Vim 7.0 or higher. 

==============================================================================
CONFIGURATION					 *EnhancedJumps-configuration*

The time span in which the jump command must be repeated to overcome the
warning about jumping into another buffer defaults to (roughly) two seconds.
To change the timeout, set a different value (in milliseconds): >
    let g:stopFirstAndNotifyTimeoutLen = 2000
<
If you do not want to override the built-in jump commands and use separate
mappings, map your keys to the <Plug>... mapping targets _before_ sourcing
this script (e.g. in your |vimrc| ). >
    nmap { <Plug>EnhancedJumpsOlder
    nmap } <Plug>EnhancedJumpsNewer
<
==============================================================================
LIMITATIONS					   *EnhancedJumps-limitations*

- If the jump target is an empty line in another unnamed buffer, and the
  current buffer contains an empty line at the target line, the jump outside
  the current buffer is not detected, and no warning given. 
- If the jump target is in another buffer, and the current buffer contains
  that buffer's filespec at the target line, the jump outside the current
  buffer is not detected, and no warning given.

HISTORY						       *EnhancedJumps-history*

1.13	16-Jul-2010
BUG: Jump opened fold at current position when "No newer/older jump position"
error occurred.

1.12    17-Jul-2009
BF: Trailing space after the command to open the folds accidentally moved
cursor one position to the right of the jump target. 

1.11	14-Jul-2009
BF: A '^\)' in the jump text caused "E55: Unmatched \)"

1.10	06-Jul-2009
- ENH: To overcome the next buffer warning, a previously given [count] need
  not be specified again. A jump command with a different [count] than last
  time now is treated as a separate jump command and thus doesn't overcome the
  next buffer warning. 
- BF: Folds at the jump target must be explicitly opened. 

1.00	01-Jul-2009
First published version.
